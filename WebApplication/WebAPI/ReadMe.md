Aim: To explore, implement & test Restful APIs

Roadmap:
1. Write clean Restful APIs.
2. Use swagger for UI.
3. Add Database context for storage.
4. Introduce Autharization & Authentication (OAuth/JWT tokens) to access the data.
5. Write a testable code.
6. Write test cases using NUnit.
 

Acheivements:
1. Implemented all Restful APIs while resolving occured Error.
2. Used Swagger UI (In-built facility was available).
3. Created account of Azure and created Azure SQL Database using free subscription. 
   Intigrated Azure SQL DB in the code and stored data over the DB using Restful APIs. 
4. Added NUnit project to test all REST methods in the Controller class in WebAPI project
